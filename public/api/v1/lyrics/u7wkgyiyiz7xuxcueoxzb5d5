  "lyrics": "[Verse]\nIn the quiet of the evening\nShadows start to sway\nUnderneath the ancient oak where the memories lay\nHer voice was like a whisper\nCaught within the leaves\nLove lost in the twilight\nCarried on the breeze\n\n[Verse 2]\nWe danced by the river\nWhere the willows softly bend\nPromises like raindrops\nWe thought would never end\nBut the tides of time were stronger\nWashed away our dreams\nLeft us with the echoes\nOf forgotten summer schemes\n\n[Chorus]\nWhispers in the wind\nCalling out her name\nGone with the night\nNothing is the same\nHaunting all my days\nCan't escape the sound\nOf whispers in the wind\nIn my heart they're bound\n\n[Verse 3]\nThe fields are ever golden\nSame as they have been\nBut now the sun sets lower\nOn dreams that might have been\nI walk the path of silence\nWhere we used to roam\nEvery sigh\nA longing\nFor the love I've known\n\n[Chorus]\nWhispers in the wind\nCalling out her name\nGone with the night\nNothing is the same\nHaunting all my days\nCan't escape the sound\nOf whispers in the wind\nIn my heart they're bound\n\n[Bridge]\nStars above are weeping\nThey know the lost embrace\nMoonlight through the branches\nA glimpse of her grace\nBut morning always shatters\nThe dreams from yesternight\nLeaving me with whispers\nFading with the light"
