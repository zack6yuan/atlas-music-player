  "lyrics": "[Verse]\nIn a field of daisies I stand tall\nElectric wildflower I break the mold\nWaves crash inside me I won’t fall\nUnapologetic bold fierce and bold\n\n[Verse 2]\nWith every color I embrace my light\nPetals dancing under the moon's glow\nStars above whisper my inner might\nFree spirit come to life watch me flow\n\n[Chorus]\nI’m an electric wildflower can’t you see\nBending rules and living wild and free\nI bloom in chaos that's where I thrive\nIn my own garden I come alive\n\n[Verse 3]\nRaindrops kiss my face in the haze\nI find strength in nature’s embrace\nRoots run deep through endless ways\nA force of beauty pure and uncaged\n\n[Bridge]\nHear my song carried by the breeze\nA melody that flows with ease\nNo chains no bounds just skies and trees\nIn my world there's only me\n\n[Chorus]\nI’m an electric wildflower can’t you see\nBending rules and living wild and free\nI bloom in chaos that's where I thrive\nIn my own garden I come alive"
