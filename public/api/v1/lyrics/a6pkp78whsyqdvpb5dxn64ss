    "lyrics": "[Verse]\nStaring at the ceiling shadows creep\nWhispers of past lives we couldn't keep\nEchoes of dreams we drowned in the deep\nFading shadows haunt the places we sleep\n\n[Verse 2]\nBroken promises like shattered glass\nMemories scatter on a troubled path\nTruth in a bottle we dared not ask\nFading shadows slip through our grasp\n\n[Chorus]\nWe used to shine like stars in the night\nNow we wander lost without a light\nFading shadows in the dim twilight\nWe reach for a day that’s out of sight\n\n[Verse 3]\nDust settles on the words we never spoke\nTangled in silence our connection broke\nEyes that once sparkled now cloak\nFading shadows cloak us like a joke\n\n[Bridge]\nFighting the ghosts that we left behind\nIn the ruins of the life we designed\nSearching for solace we can't find\nFading shadows clouding our mind\n\n[Chorus]\nWe used to shine like stars in the night\nNow we wander lost without a light\nFading shadows in the dim twilight\nWe reach for a day that’s out of sight"
