  "lyrics": "[Verse]\nShadows linger in the night\nDreams like chains hold us tight\nWhispers echo endless fight\nTime to rise into the light\n\n[Verse 2]\nWalls are closing pressing hard\nVoices silent battle's scarred\nStand together we're unbarred\nTruth of freedom disregard\n\n[Chorus]\nShatter the silence scream and shout\nTear down the barriers break them out\nNo more hiding no more doubt\nWe'll stand tall when walls fall out\n\n[Verse 3]\nDarkness can't persist for long\nLight within us far too strong\nPass the torch the final song\nWe'll be right where we belong\n\n[Verse 4]\nEvery wound we've ever known\nEvery fear we've ever sown\nIt's the path that weâ€™ve outgrown\nBraving storms no more alone\n\n[Bridge]\nEchoes fade in twilight's gleam\nLive the truth beyond the dream\nChange the course shift the stream\nForce the dawn no longer scheme"
