  "lyrics": "[Verse]\nNeon lights set the sky afire\nWe chase the night hearts caught in a wire\nSweat drops pearling while we move as one\nElectric fever we’re the chosen ones\n\n[Verse 2]\nFeel the pulse in the rhythm of the beat\nLost in the crowd our senses meet\nLights are flashing shadows intertwine\nElectric fever lovers lost in time\n\n[Chorus]\nWe’re electrified in the neon glow\nTime’s a broken clock when we let it go\nFeel the charge the sparks between our dreams\nElectric fever nothing as it seems\n\n[Bridge]\nRising tension tempting every soul\nArpeggios take control\nBuilding up to a cosmic eruption\nElectric fever feeds the seduction\n\n[Verse 3]\nSyncopated beats make the night ignite\nHearts colliding in blinding light\nVoices echo through the endless nights\nElectric fever sets our spirits alight\n\n[Chorus]\nWe’re electrified in the neon glow\nTime’s a broken clock when we let it go\nFeel the charge the sparks between our dreams\nElectric fever nothing as it seems"
