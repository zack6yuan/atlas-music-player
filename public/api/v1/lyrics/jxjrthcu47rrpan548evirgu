  "lyrics": "[Verse]\nSunlight filters through the trees\nTime drifts like the summer breeze\nGolden moments slip away\nIn this endless lazy day\n\n[Verse 2]\nFootprints fade on sandy shore\nEchoes from a distant roar\nWhispers of the ocean's tale\nIn the golden haze we sail\n\n[Chorus]\nFleeting moments hold us tight\nStars will guide us through the night\nEvery memory will stay\nIn this golden summer haze\n\n[Verse 3]\nLaughter fills the twilight air\nDreams we chase without a care\nMoonlight dances on the waves\nAs the night and day misbehave\n\n[Chorus]\nFleeting moments hold us tight\nStars will guide us through the night\nEvery memory will stay\nIn this golden summer haze\n\n[Bridge]\nTime may fade these autumn days\nBut in our hearts the golden stays\nWe'll remember our sweet phase\nIn the warm and gentle blaze"
