  "lyrics": "[Verse]\nMoonlight dances on the ocean's face\nWaves sing stories of a timeless place\nSoft whispers in the night keep pace\nWith echoing dreams in endless space\n\n[Verse 2]\nStarfish conjure a celestial relay\nCoral gardens where the sea nymphs play\nCurrents carry whispers far away\nIn the heart of the deep we stay\n\n[Chorus]\nTidal drift takes me home\nIn the serene vast unknown\nFlowing peace where I roam\nIn every wave I'm not alone\n\n[Verse 3]\nShelter in the shells they hold\nSecrets gleam like sunlit gold\nIn the depths where tales unfold\nAncient whispers softly told\n\n[Bridge]\nBreathing rhythms of the sea\nEchoes in tranquility\nSoftly calling out to me\nIn the flow where I am free\n\n[Verse 4]\nGentle sway of unseen hands\nGuides me through these liquid lands\nBoundless love in ocean's strands\nForever in this place I stand"
