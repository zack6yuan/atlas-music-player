  "lyrics": "[Verse]\nCity lights are gleamin'\nStreets alive tonight\nRhythms in the hustle\nGroove's feelin' just right (oo-yeah!)\nPeople movin'\nShakin'\nUnder neon glow\nLife's a funky journey\nLet's go with the flow\n\n[Verse 2]\nTaxi horns are beepin'\nMusic in the air (uh-huh!)\nEverybody's vibin'\nNo one has a care\nSidewalks full of stories\nLaughter in the breeze\nFeel the city pulsin'\nBring you to your knees\n\n[Chorus]\nCome on\nFeel the rhythm of this urban serenade (oh-oh!)\nEvery corner hummin'\nWhere the joy is made\nWe got the groove\nYeah! Get up and play\nLet the night take over\nHear the city sway\n\n[Verse 3]\nFood trucks on the corner\nSmells that make you swoon (mm-mm!)\nDancers on the street will have you tappin’ soon\nCouples locked in step to that city beat\nLiving for the moment\nLife is oh so sweet (so sweet!)\n\n[Bridge]\nHigh-rise towers glowin'\nStars begin to peek\nFind a hidden jazz club\nSecrets start to speak (shh!)\nMelodies and memories\nBlend into the night\nUrban serenade\nThe city’s pure delight\n\n[Chorus]\nCome on\nFeel the rhythm of this urban serenade (oh-oh!)\nEvery corner hummin'\nWhere the joy is made\nWe got the groove\nYeah! Get up and play\nLet the night take over\nHear the city sway"
