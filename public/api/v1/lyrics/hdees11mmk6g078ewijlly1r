  "lyrics": "[Verse]\nStars ignite in dark twilight\nMind unbound in endless flight\nEchoes lost in cosmic stream\nWaking souls in silent dream\n\n[Verse 2]\nNebulae whisper tales untold\nGalaxies blazin' bright and bold\nPlanet dust in my weary hand\nSeekin' truths in unknown lands\n\n[Chorus]\nDriftin' far we lose our chains\nFeel the pull away from plains\nGravity fades hearts aligned\nJourney deep into the mind\n\n[Verse 3]\nWormholes twist through timeless skies\nMystic trails in my eyes\nComets sing in cosmic hum\nWorlds collide in astral drum\n\n[Bridge]\nVisions steeped in lunar blue\nChasin' shadows ever true\nVoices call from distant edge\nLife reborn on stardust ledge\n\n[Verse 4]\nLight years pass in fleeting sigh\nShooting stars in nighttime high\nDreams consumed by restless night\nCaught within the fire's light"
